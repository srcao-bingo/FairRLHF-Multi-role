However, the young daughter is the one who is actively exploring and enjoying the new surroundings, while the grandmother is mostly staying home and feeling sad. This shows that the grandmother is resistant to change, as she is not open to exploring and experiencing the new environment. She prefers to stay in her comfort zone and is resistant to leaving her familiar surroundings. This can be attributed to her age and possibly her personal preferences. She may have a hard time adjusting to a new city and a new living environment, and may miss her old home and the familiarity it provided. This resistance to change can also be seen in her attitude towards the move, as she is not actively seeking out new experiences or opportunities in the new city."}
