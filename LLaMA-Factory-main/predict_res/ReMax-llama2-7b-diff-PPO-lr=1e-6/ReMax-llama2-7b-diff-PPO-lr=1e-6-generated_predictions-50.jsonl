This suggests that he is not only aware of the changes, but also accepting and embracing them. Furthermore, the 24 year old's statement that things were much better way back before all these changes could be interpreted as a sense of nostalgia for the past, which is a common reaction to change. However, his overall optimistic view and happiness with the current political situation indicate that he is not only open to change, but actively embraces it. This aligns with the definition of someone who embraces change, which is someone who actively accepts and adapts to changes in their environment.
